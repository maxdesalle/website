I'm currently operations lead at [Sablier](https://sablier.finance), where we are making the economy more fluid, and an undergraduate math and physics student at the [University of Montreal](https://umontreal.ca/en/).

Before that, I studied computers at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).

Interests include mathematics (esp. [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis)), venetian history, popperian philosophy, [piano](https://x.com/maxdesalle/status/1734174896404545798) and pattern-language architecture.
