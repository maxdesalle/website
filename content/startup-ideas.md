This is an unordered list of (sometimes terrible) startup ideas I have, and potentially plan to pursue if no else pursues them. Feel free to use of any of these ideas for your next startup, it would make the world a much better place!

**Adaptive music app:** an app using machine learning to read and analyze everything in real time you are doing on your computer (all the data stays local, obviously) to find the best type of music for the current moment. Seamlessly switches from song to song based on the work you are doing on your computer, the mood the app thinks you are in, time of day, etc.

Should integrate with traditional streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. Could probably be built as an extension on top of [Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/).

Business model: pay once, use it forever (one computer only). For an additional X dollars, you get lifetime updates as well.

**Real-time economy dashboards:** think of these COVID-19 map dashboards, but with faster updates and for the economy. You would be able to track the impact of interest rates increases in real time and in specific places. Basically needs to be a [Dune](https://dune.com)-like service, but for the "real" economy.

The [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve), banks and major companies would be your first clients. Data could come from [ChainLink](https://chain.link) oracles, or a network of incentivized data providers in the region you are initially targetting.

Should probably initially focus on getting integrated with traditional payment providers, this can either be done from the top (partner with Mastercard, Visa, etc.), or from the bottom (provide a plug and play solution merchants can add that sends data to you, in exchange for some type of reward system).

Business model is very simple: free users get access to the dashboard, but with a delay of 24 hours for example, and paid users get instant updates in real time with daily or weekly reports and additional metrics.

**Non-misogynistic, non-incel masculine media:** there is a real gap in the market at the moment regarding content creators teaching men about masculinity, faterhood and marriage while _not_ giving misogynistic/incel vibes like most current outlets do.

The content would be a mix of stoicism, chivalry and ethics.

It would focus on modernizing these old values and principles.

Business model is simple: a subscription for additional content, ads, writing books and promoting them to the audience, and organizing paid meet-ups (once the community is large enough) where the audience can meet and build relationships.

It should absolutely avoid the clich√©s like "how to be a gentleman" or "how to dress like a gentleman" and focus on what really matters: principles, values and moral codes.

**Cayman-Islands-as-a-service (CIAAS):** offer all the fiscal optimizations/structures the rich use to pay as few taxes as possible to the global population.

I have really no idea how to achieve this, though.
