I lead operations at [Sablier](https://sablier.com). Alongside this, I'm an undergraduate student in mathematics and physics at the [University of Montreal](https://umontreal.ca/en/).

Before that, I studied computer science at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) in Brussels.

My mindset in life is to *win and help win*.
