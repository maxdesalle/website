Everyone can be wealthy. Everyone. Building wealth is a skill like any other skill. Some people are good at running, others at building wealth. And like running, you can train for it.

## Leverage

*This part of the blog post is heavily based on the ideas of [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al).*

**Building wealth is all about leverage**. You want to get in a position where you are maximally leveraged with as little effort as possible. Code and media dominate in this as they enable infinite leverage without any hassle.

A developer can create an app which can be used by millions of users, without having to hire anybody or requiring a specific amount of capital. A video on YouTube requires little to no capital to create and can be watched hundreds of millions of times.

The best part is that the developer doesn't need to be there when you are using the app. He can sleep, as he isn't earning with his time, he is earning with his mind. The same applies to the YouTuber.

**Build things that don't sleep**. That's it. Build an app which can be used when you are sleeping. Build a YouTube channel where people can watch videos, even when you sleep.

### Earn with your mind, not your time

**You can't get rich by selling out your time**. You have no leverage with time, because you can only do one thing at a time. Leverage is about doing more with that same time.

If you are a consultant payed by the hour for example, it doesn't matter what you do, you will receive a specific income every hour. You aren't in a position of leverage because whether you do a good or a bad job your income won't change. If you are a consultant and create an analytics platform which your clients can use without you having to assist them, you have leverage.

**Whatever your job, you can place yourself in a position where you are maximally leveraged with as little effort as possible**. It's just a matter of thinking about it.

**If you can't code, create content**. Anyone can create content, no excuses. It's free to do, and you can quickly get started by sharing your knowledge with the world.

### Knowledge

If you had infinite knowledge, you would be the most happy, wealthy and obviously knowledgeable person on Earth. Knowledge is the real path to wealth.

**Specific and diverse knowledge is what you want to be looking for**. Specific because the deeper you get in the knowledge, the less likely it is that someone else has your level of knowledge. Diverse because the more diverse knowledge you have, the less likely it is that someone else has has a similar knowledge combination.

If you are for example good at code, fine. But if you are good at code, design and economics, now that's interesting. Quite a lot of people are good at code, fewer are good at code and design, and even fewer are good at code, design and economics.

Like Naval would put it: **if you are good at building and selling, you will be unstoppable**. You can learn how to build and sell by acquiring knowledge. There are hundreds of thousands of books out there, just start reading them.

### Be at the frontier of innovation

You want to work in a space which is at the frontier of innovation; a sector which hasn't matured yet enough in order to be accessible to the average person. In the 90s, this was the Internet. Right now, this is more than probably crypto. In the future, it may become AI, AR and VR, or even Quantum computers in a few decades.

By being part of a radically innovative sector, you get a ton of leverage freely by being an early-adopter. Imagine if you could have joined Facebook, Google or Amazon back when these companies were still small startups. Or if you had "just" created a blog at that time, or created a YouTube-like website.

**Being early is free leverage**.

## Investing

*This part of the blog post is heavily based on the ideas of [John Bogle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp) and [JL Collins](jlcollinsnh.com/).*

*Note: when I talk about the stock market performance, I talk about the SP500's average performance on a multi-decade period.*

Investing is something which everyone should do, but only few really do. And even fewer do it properly.

This is probably because it's not taught at schools, and a lot of people worry about losing their money. But remember: **by holding your capital in cash you are constantly losing money**. Inflation is a thing.

Given the +-2% yearly inflation, you are effectively losing 2% of your funds on average every year by keeping them in cash. On a ten-year timeline that's nearly 20% you will lose, without actually realizing it as you are losing purchasing power, not money.

So if you are worried about investing because you don't like losing money, the joke is on you. Also, remember that when you invest in the stock market, you own things. **Whether the market goes up or down, you still own the shares of these companies**.

This means that **every single day, from Monday to Friday (if not during the weekend) tens, hundreds, thousands if not millions of people are going to work to make your investment profitable**. If you own a part of a company, say 1% to make it easy, whether your shares increase or decrease in value doesn't change the fact that you still own 1% of the company.

Before you ask, **there are no get-rich-quick schemes**. If it's profitable, it's risky. And if it looks too good to be true, it **is** (not maybe, it just is) too good to be true.

### Avoid debt at all costs

**Debt is the modern and widely accepted version of slavery**. It chains you to your paycheck-to-paycheck life. The fact that debt is so widely accepted is absolutely astonishing. Especially student loan debt.

A highly diversified index fund like the SP500 returns on average +-5% every year on a 40-year period without reinvested dividents and with inflation taken into account\*\.

*\*Past performance is in no way indication for future performance.*

Because of that, if your debt is lower than 2-3%, you can pay it off slowly and already start investing in the market. If your debt is between 3-5%, your choice. If it's higher than 5%, pay it off as soon as possible.

To summarize: **avoid debt like the plague**.

### When to invest

**Never invest your capital all at once**. Invest every month a specific amount of money instead. And whether you have already some funds to invest or you don't, you should dedicate a portion of your salary going straight to it every month.

The reason why you should invest every month instead of all at once is that **you never know where the market is going**. No one does. And if someone hypothetically knew where the market is going, he would already be wealthier than Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos combined. But guess what? No one is.

You will lose money on a short-term perspective during certain periods of time. **Crashes will happen**. It's not if, it's when. These things happen and are needed to keep the market in check. **What goes up, must go down**.

If someone tells you a crash, or a boom is coming at a specific date, they are either lying or highly incompetent. **No one can predict the future**. No one. And for all the gurus on CNBC telling people a crash is coming, a crash is always coming. The question is when. Interestingly, they never seem to have an answer for the "when" question.

Simply put: **You never know where the market is going which is why you should invest regularly in the market**.

### How to invest

**The larger the share of your income dedicated to investing, the sooner you will be financially indepedent**. Ideally, you should try to invest 50% of your income. That's a lot, which is why most people will probably only "afford" 20-30%. If you can only afford less than that, no worries, the compounding nature of investing is on your side.

It may be worth it to reconsider your spendings. It's a choice you make after all. Do you really need that new t-shirt, or that new iPhone? Do you really need it? There is no right answer. Maybe you need it, maybe you don't. Be honest with yourself.

**You don't necessarily need to be frugal to grow wealthy, but it definitely won't hurt**. When buying a house for example, you should probably seek the least house to meet your needs rather than the most house you can technically afford, like JL Collins would put it.

### What to invest in

Some people will suggest a highly diversified basket of stocks, bonds, index funds, commodities... Truth is that by following that strategy, you will ruin yourself with the trading fees, as well as in time given you will need to rebalance your portfolio constantly.

Because of that, **the simpler your investments are, the better**. Don't make it too complicated. Complication means most of the time more fees, which aren't negligible. Investing in specific stocks isn't investing simply. It requires a lot of research, and times change. The company leading the market now, might not be the leader anymore in the future. Or maybe it might, you never know.

Additionally, the less risky the bets you are making, the better. When you invest in a technology-focused index like the NASDAQ for example, you are betting on the growth of the tech sector. That's probably a riskier bet to take than betting on the general growth of the economy, for example.

This is why index funds like the SP500 are interesting as they represent the whole American economy, not just a specific sector. **Instead of trying to find the needle, invest in the whole haystack**. If a company is doing well, it will eventually get into the index which will lead to more profit. If a company isn't doing well, it will eventually get out of the index which will limit the losses.

The only bet you are making when investing in the SP500 is the growth of the economy. Whether tech companies continue to dominate or healthcare becomes the new deal doesn't matter. **You own everything**.

**It's worth mentioning that investing in the SP500 is what legendary stock market investor Warren Buffet advises for "average" people**. It's common sense investing, like John Bogle would put it.

Now, if you still believe you are smarter than everyone else in terms of investing, feel free to do it your own way and pick individual stocks. But remember, **there is a reason why you aren't as wealthy as Warren Buffet or Jeff Bezos**. The reason being you are probably not that good at investing, like nearly everyone else, including me. Again, it's not possible to predict the future. And when you make more bets than just the growth of the economy, you are contradicting that fact.

### Early retirement

**Once you have enough wealth invested in the stock market, you are financially free**. If you want to retire, you can. If you don't want to, you don't have to. Once you have financial freedom, anything is possible.

It's generally widely accepted that **you need to be able to live with 4% of the capital you have invested in the stock market**. The idea being that, given the stock market goes up on average a bit more than that (+-4.8%, without dividends and inflation taken into account), you will keep your wealth stable while being able to live off of it.

Imagine your costs of living equal $20K a year, you will need 25 times that so your $20K yearly expenses equal the 4%. In this case, you will need $500K in the stock market. This is without considering the dividends, which you should probably reinvest as they compound over time.

In the ideal situation, you would just live off of the dividends. These dividends are usually between sitting between 1-2%. But that means you will need more funds in order to not having to downgrade your lifestyle because of it.
