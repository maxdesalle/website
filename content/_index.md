I lead operations at [Sablier](https://sablier.com) and I'm a fellow at [Conjecture Institute](https://www.conjectureinstitute.org/).

Alongside this, I'm an undergraduate student in mathematics and physics at the [University of Montreal](https://umontreal.ca/en/). Before that, I studied computer science at [42](https://42belgium.be/en/) in Brussels.

My mindset in life is to *win and help win*.
