I'm currently operations lead at [Sablier](https://sablier.finance), where we are making the economy more fluid, and an undergraduate math and physics student at the [University of Montreal](https://umontreal.ca/en/).

Before that, I worked at [Hifi Finance](https://hifi.finance) in marketing while [learning to code in C and C++](https://github.com/maxdesalle) at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).

During my free time, I like to play [piano](https://twitter.com/maxdesalle/status/1734174896404545798/video/1), learn [languages](https://twitter.com/maxdesalle/status/1657845827182665728), read [books](https://maxdesalle.com/resources/), and [write](http://localhost:1313/in-defense-of-growth-and-capitalism/).
