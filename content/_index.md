I'm currently operations lead at [Sablier](https://sablier.finance), where we are making the economy more fluid, and an undergraduate math and physics student at the [University of Montreal](https://umontreal.ca/en/).

Before that, I studied computers at [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).

Interests include [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis) and [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis) analysis, [everettian quantum mechanics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/), [venetian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Republic_of_Venice), [popperian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) and [pattern-language architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language).
