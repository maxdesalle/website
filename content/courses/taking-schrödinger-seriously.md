> With gratitude to [Conjecture Institute](https://www.conjectureinstitute.org/) for enabling this work.

Starting from the Schrödinger equation itself, this course builds your understanding of quantum mechanics from first principles.

You'll learn what each symbol means, where the wave function lives, and how time evolution, superposition, and entanglement follow from the math. Then measurement, branching, and decoherence—all without collapse.

Modules are listed below. Full course available [here](https://conjectureinstitute.org/university/courses#:~:text=Taking%20Schr%C3%B6dinger%20Seriously).
